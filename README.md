As part of the case study 24 for the course Problem Solving with C, this is teh project for a simple Command Line Movie booking System.

Currently Version : The entire code has been implemented as a menu driven program using structures and dynamic memory allocation.

Future Scope: Add File Handling principles to store previous user data so that the auditorium view feature works better and is more realistic. Add more colour and design the menu properly.
